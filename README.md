## <h2 style="text-align:center" id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

This is a single page website.

I built this website as a way to practice my javascript skills. 

It was a way for me to design, code and deploy a single page application whilst reinforcing the basic skill set of any Full Stack programmer.

The site can be used as an example of basic javascript. Including functions, if statements, variables and more. 

As a result of this work I have learnt and refined the basics for website design using javascript.
